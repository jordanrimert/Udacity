Read Me!

Welcome to my GitHub. Please find the projects I worked on while studying Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning at Udacity.com. Each of the projects contains the necessary python script and data. Some are interactive, while others are just general scripts that show an understanding of the subject matter. 

Each sub folder will contain a markdown file which can be used to explain each project. Please feel free to follow me on LinkedIn and reach out if you have any questions!
